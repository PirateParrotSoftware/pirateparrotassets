    <p class="section-desc">
      Pirate Parrot is a small independent team focused on creating high-quality, production-tested assets for game developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we work as a team, most of the development and support are handled personally — backed by over a decade of programming and game development experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We build the kind of tools and assets we once needed ourselves.
      Every release starts as something made for our own projects — tested, improved, and then shared with the community.
      That’s why we aim for the same level of quality we’d expect in our own production pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our main focus is usability — clean hierarchy, clear structure, and efficiency in real-world use.
      All assets are designed with a technical mindset, ensuring they’re reliable, lightweight, and easy to integrate into your workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our work is published on the Unity Asset Store, with some 3D content also adapted for Unreal Engine.
      We love seeing our assets used in real projects — it’s the best reward for the effort we put into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      First released on the Unity Asset Store in May 2017, Pirate Parrot continues to grow steadily, delivering updates and new content to the developer community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re open to collaboration proposals — if something truly interesting comes along, we’re always willing to discuss it.
